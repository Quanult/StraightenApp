A PyThon application for straighten chromosomes described in the following paper:
* Improving Classification of Curved Chromosomes in Karyotyping using CNN-based Deformation
* Video demo: https://youtu.be/aJ3REQeBrGo

## Installation & requirements
Assuming  Python and pip are set up, the Python-packages used by this code can be installed using:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Create a 'weight' folder and download the pretrained weight for straightening chromosome by spatial transformer network at [pretrained](https://vnueduvn-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/18021031_vnu_edu_vn/Edfh4gMYWYxLjvctCAS-XoYBF9goK7VmDmsoAs4mZpl4WQ?e=bnTg9a) in that file
